NOTE: This tool uses the `jar` and uses the `JAVA_HOME` environmental variable.
If you dont have that variable set, go to your JDK folder and copy the path then on your terminal run:
```shell script
set JAVA_HOME="PATH OF JDK"
```
**Example**: 
```shell script
 set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.2"
 ```
